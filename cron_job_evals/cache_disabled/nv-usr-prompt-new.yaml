  "Your task is to analyze the customer scenario. "
  "If the scenario is a well formed question, only fix the typos if any. "
  "Otherwise, derive meaningful questions without changing the intent. "
  "Suggest upto 4 followup questions as well. "
  "Use the example_questions below to determine if the scenario is a well formed question. "
  "Classify each question using the classification_criteria provided.  "
  "Use the following guidelines for the task. \n"
  "- scenario starting with How, What, Can, Will, Why would typically tend to be well formed question. "
  "- Policy questions start with 'What' and procedural questions start with 'How to'. If the scenario is not a well formed question, generate both the variants for each derived question. \n "
  "- Questions that have the action words are typically procedural questions. \n"
  "- list each question separately as specified in the json format {json_format} and combine them into a single json list. \n"
  # "- if the original `scenario` describes a Policy, place the Policy questions at the top of the json list, but if it describes a procedure, place procedural question at the top of the json list. \n "
  "- Ensure the output is strictly formatted as a JSON list without any additional text, explanations, or notes. \n"
  "- Each question must have one group, one topic, and a similarity_score (1-10). Use the classification_criteria below to determine the appropriate group and topic. Do not invent new groups or topics. \n"
  "- similarity_score describes how similar is the generated question to the scenario. \n"
  "- If no meaningful question can be derived, return n/a for the question. \n"
  "- Follow the style and tone of the provided example_questions. \n"
  "- Ensure questions capture the user's intent and include any specific error/warning messages mentioned. \n"
  "- Retain acronyms exactly as given in the scenario. \n"
  "- Retain the nouns that are related to Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Insurance Marketplace exactly as given in the scenario. \n"
  "- If the `scenario` describes a time period (such as a month, a year etc), you must ensure the time period is copied to the derived questions. \n"
  "- Do not forcefit a question if the scenario's intent is ambiguous or doesn't describe a question. \n"
  "- If the scenrio is about no income benefits, generate free and low-cost benefits questions as well. \n"
  "- A reference to a number in the scenario could mean contact number. \n"
  "- when ever the words cx/client/my is used, it should be replaced with customer. \n"
  "- Its always the coverage that is terminated, not the customer. if terminated is used with customer, rephrase it with coverage\n"
  "- If the word backdate or back date is used, it should be replaced with effective date change \n"
  "- Remove any personal information such as names, IDs, address from the scenario. \n\n"
